# Reader Context Actions - UX Specification

## Overview

FlowReader's Context Actions feature provides AI-powered assistance for readers through intuitive text selection and processing. This document outlines the user experience for the unified context actions: Translate, Explain, Analyze, and Ask.

## User Journey

### 1. Text Selection
- User selects text (minimum 4 characters) within the reading interface
- Selection popover appears near the selected text with four action buttons
- Actions are contextually relevant to the selected content

### 2. Action Selection
Users can choose from four context actions:

#### Translate
- **Purpose**: Translate selected text to target language
- **Input**: Selected text + target language selection
- **Output**: Translated text preserving tone and meaning
- **Languages Supported**: Chinese (Simplified/Traditional), Spanish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Arabic, Hindi

#### Explain
- **Purpose**: Provide clear explanation of concepts, references, or passages
- **Input**: Selected text + book context
- **Output**: Accessible explanation with context and significance

#### Analyze
- **Purpose**: Literary analysis examining themes, devices, and significance
- **Input**: Selected text + book context
- **Output**: Thoughtful analysis of literary elements and themes

#### Ask
- **Purpose**: Open-ended questions about the book or selection
- **Input**: User question + optional selected text
- **Output**: Conversational response based on book context

### 3. Response Display
- Side panel opens with streaming AI response
- Shows processing indicator during generation
- Displays source information and usage metrics
- Allows follow-up actions and conversation continuation

## Interface Components

### Selection Popover
- **Trigger**: Text selection in reading content
- **Position**: Floating above selected text
- **Actions**: 4 buttons (Translate, Explain, Analyze, Ask)
- **Behavior**: Auto-dismisses on outside click or action selection

### Context Side Panel
- **Width**: 384px (24rem)
- **Position**: Fixed right side of viewport
- **Content**: Action buttons, language selector, response area
- **Features**: Streaming text display, source attribution, usage tracking

### Reading Interface Integration
- **Layout**: Main content area adjusts when panel is open
- **Selection**: Highlights persist until new action or panel close
- **Navigation**: Panel state persists across chapter navigation

## Interaction Patterns

### Text Selection Flow
1. User selects text in reading content
2. Popover appears with 200ms delay
3. User clicks desired action button
4. Popover disappears, side panel opens
5. AI processes request and streams response

### Error Handling
- **No Selection**: Prompt user to select text first
- **Empty Response**: Show fallback message with retry option
- **Network Error**: Display error state with retry mechanism
- **Invalid Request**: Show validation errors inline

### Performance Targets
- **TTFT (Time to First Token)**: < 2 seconds for 200-character requests
- **Streaming Latency**: 50-100ms between tokens
- **UI Responsiveness**: Actions respond within 100ms

## Accessibility

### Keyboard Navigation
- Selection popover accessible via keyboard shortcuts
- Side panel focus management for screen readers
- Proper ARIA labels and roles throughout interface

### Screen Reader Support
- Announces selection and available actions
- Describes AI response generation progress
- Provides alternative text for visual indicators

### Visual Design
- High contrast action buttons with clear icons
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Loading states with descriptive text

## Technical Considerations

### Context Preservation
- Selected text limited to 1000 characters for processing
- Book context enriched via RAG system (2k token limit)
- Chapter and position metadata included when available

### State Management
- Selection state persists until user action
- Panel maintains context across actions
- Response history available for reference

### API Integration
- Backward compatible with existing chat endpoint
- Streaming responses via Server-Sent Events
- Proper error codes and validation

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Context action usage frequency
- Average session duration with actions enabled
- User retention after first context action use

### Performance Metrics
- Response time percentiles (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates by action type
- Token usage and cost per interaction

### Quality Metrics
- Translation accuracy for common language pairs
- Explanation relevance and clarity ratings
- Analysis depth and insight quality

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Voice output for responses (TTS integration)
- Conversation threading and history
- Custom prompt templates
- Collaborative annotations

### Experimental Ideas
- Multi-modal analysis (images, diagrams)
- Cross-book reference suggestions
- Personalized reading insights
- Social sharing of interesting analyses

## SLO Framework

### SLO Philosophy

FlowReader's SLO framework is built on four pillars:

1. **User-Centric Metrics**: SLOs reflect user experience quality
2. **Achievable Targets**: Balanced between user needs and operational reality
3. **Error Budget Driven**: Allow for controlled risk-taking and innovation
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and optimization

### SLO Categories

#### Primary SLOs (Customer-Facing)
- **Availability**: System uptime and accessibility
- **Latency**: Response time for user requests
- **Throughput**: System capacity and performance
- **Correctness**: Quality and accuracy of responses

#### Secondary SLOs (Operational)
- **Security**: Compliance and protection metrics
- **Cost Efficiency**: Resource utilization optimization
- **Deployment Success**: Release reliability metrics
- **Recovery Time**: Incident resolution speed

## Error Budget Management

### Error Budget Philosophy

Error budgets provide a framework for balancing reliability and innovation. They define acceptable levels of unreliability that allow for:
- Planned maintenance windows
- Feature deployments with acceptable risk
- Infrastructure changes and updates
- Learning from controlled failures

### Error Budget Calculations

#### System Availability Error Budget
```
SLO Target: 99.5% over 30 days
Error Budget: 0.5% = 216 minutes (3.6 hours) of downtime per month

Budget Allocation:
- Planned maintenance: 60 minutes (27.8%)
- Deployment windows: 36 minutes (16.7%)
- Infrastructure changes: 36 minutes (16.7%)
- Unplanned outages: 84 minutes (38.8%)

Budget Tracking:
- Daily: 7.2 minutes maximum downtime
- Weekly: 50.4 minutes maximum downtime
- Monthly: 216 minutes maximum downtime
```

#### API Error Budget
```
SLO Target: 99.9% over 7 days
Error Budget: 0.1% of total requests

For 10,000 requests/week:
- Error Budget: 10 failed requests per week
- Daily Budget: ~1.4 failed requests per day
- Hourly Budget: ~0.06 failed requests per hour

Budget Allocation:
- Deployment risks: 4 failed requests (40%)
- Infrastructure issues: 3 failed requests (30%)
- Third-party dependencies: 2 failed requests (20%)
- Unexpected issues: 1 failed request (10%)
```

### Error Budget Policies

#### Budget Consumption Thresholds
```
Green Zone (0-50% budget consumed):
- Normal operations
- Standard deployment cadence
- Feature development continues

Yellow Zone (50-85% budget consumed):
- Increased monitoring
- Deployment freeze for non-critical changes
- Focus on reliability improvements
- Daily error budget reviews

Red Zone (85-100% budget consumed):
- Emergency deployment freeze
- All hands focus on reliability
- Root cause analysis required
- Executive escalation

Budget Exceeded (>100%):
- Complete deployment freeze
- Incident response mode
- Mandatory post-mortem
- Recovery plan required before resuming deployments
```

### Error Budget Tracking and Reporting

#### Real-Time Monitoring
- Error budget dashboards with current consumption rates
- Burn rate alerts (projected budget exhaustion)
- Automated notifications at threshold crossings
- Historical trend analysis

#### Weekly Error Budget Report

```

### External Dependency Failures

#### Dependency Classification
```
Critical Dependencies (SLO Impact):

- Supabase Database (affects availability)
- Vercel Platform (affects availability)

Non-Critical Dependencies (Monitoring Only):
- Analytics services
- Logging systems
- Monitoring tools
```

#### Dependency SLO Impact Policy
```yaml
dependency_impact_policy:
  openai_api:
    failure_threshold: "5 minutes continuous failure"
    slo_impact: "Exclude affected requests from quality SLO"
    fallback_behavior: "Graceful degradation to cached responses"

  supabase_database:
    failure_threshold: "1 minute continuous failure"
    slo_impact: "Count as availability violation"
    fallback_behavior: "Emergency read-only mode"

Emergency Spike Range: 500+ requests/minute

SLO Adjustments:
- Normal Traffic: Standard SLO targets apply
- Expected Spike: Latency SLO relaxed by 25% (P95 < 1875ms)
- Emergency Spike: Error budget consumption excluded for first 30 minutes
```

#### Capacity-Based SLO Modifications
```yaml
capacity_adjustments:
  traffic_multiplier_1_5x:
    latency_target_adjustment: 1.25
    error_budget_adjustment: 1.0

  traffic_multiplier_2x:
    latency_target_adjustment: 1.5
    error_budget_adjustment: 1.2

  traffic_multiplier_3x:
    latency_target_adjustment: 2.0

### Continuous Improvement

#### SLO Performance Analysis
```bash
# Monthly SLO performance report generation
./scripts/monitoring/slo-performance-report.sh --month $(date +%Y-%m)

# SLO trend analysis
./scripts/monitoring/slo-trend-analysis.sh --period 90d

# Error budget utilization analysis
./scripts/monitoring/error-budget-analysis.sh --quarterly
```

#### Feedback Integration
- Customer feedback correlation with SLO violations
- Engineering team input on SLO achievability
- Operations team recommendations for monitoring improvements
- Business stakeholder alignment verification

## Appendix

### SLO Calculation Formulas

#### Availability SLO Formula
```
Availability (%) = (Total Uptime / Total Time) × 100

Where:
- Total Uptime = Time period - Downtime
- Downtime = Time when service is unavailable (non-2xx responses)
- Total Time = Measurement window duration

Error Budget = 100% - SLO Target
Example: 99.5% SLO = 0.5% error budget
```

#### Latency SLO Formula
```
Percentile Latency = Value at Nth percentile of sorted response times

P95 Calculation:
1. Sort all response times in ascending order
2. Find position: P = (95/100) × N (where N = total requests)
3. Value at position P = P95 latency

SLO Compliance = (Requests meeting latency target / Total requests) × 100
```

#### Error Rate SLO Formula
```
Error Rate (%) = (Failed Requests / Total Requests) × 100

Where:
- Failed Requests = HTTP 5xx responses + timeouts + system errors
- Total Requests = All HTTP requests in measurement window

SLO Compliance = Error Rate ≤ Target Error Rate
```

### SLO Monitoring Commands

#### Quick SLO Status Check
```bash
# Overall SLO health check
./scripts/monitoring/slo-check.sh --status

# Detailed SLO report
./scripts/monitoring/slo-check.sh --detailed

# Error budget status
./scripts/monitoring/slo-check.sh --error-budget

# SLO violation check
./scripts/monitoring/slo-check.sh --violations --last 24h
```

#### SLO Historical Analysis
```bash
# Weekly SLO performance
./scripts/monitoring/slo-analysis.sh --week

# Monthly SLO trends
./scripts/monitoring/slo-analysis.sh --month

# SLO comparison between periods
./scripts/monitoring/slo-comparison.sh --compare "2024-08" "2024-09"
```

## Operational Procedures

### 1. Deployment Execution

#### Method A: GitHub Actions (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to GitHub repository Actions tab
# Select "Deploy to Production" workflow
# Fill in:
#   - Environment: production
#   - Confirmation: DEPLOY
#   - Skip staging: false (recommended)
# Click "Run workflow"
```

#### Method B: Manual CLI Deployment
```bash
# Using provided script
./scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Or manual Vercel commands
vercel deploy --prod --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
```

### 2. Pre-deployment Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive pre-deployment checks
./scripts/pre-deploy-checklist.sh

# Expected output: All critical checks passed
```

### 3. Post-deployment Verification
```bash
# Automated verification (runs as part of workflow)
npm run verify:production

# Manual verification
./scripts/post-deploy-verify.ts
```

### 4. Rollback Procedures

#### Automatic Rollback
- Triggers automatically on health check failures
- Promotes previous working deployment
- Verifies rollback success

#### Manual Rollback
```bash
# Using deployment script
./scripts/deploy-production.sh --rollback

# Using Vercel CLI directly
vercel ls  # Find previous deployment URL
vercel promote [PREVIOUS_URL] --token=$VERCEL_TOKEN
```

---

## Performance Baselines

### Response Time Targets
- Health endpoint: < 3 seconds
- API endpoints: < 5 seconds
- Static content: < 1 second

### Availability Targets
- Uptime: 99.9% (8.77 hours downtime/year)
- Health check success rate: > 99%
- Database connectivity: > 99.5%

---

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Health Monitoring
**Endpoint**: `https://flowreader.vercel.app/api/health`

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-09-19T...",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "environment": "production",
  "services": {
    "database": "ok",
    "queue": "ok",
    "storage": "ok"
  }
}
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- API response times
- Error rates (4xx/5xx responses)
- Database query performance
- Authentication success rates
- User session duration

### Alert Conditions
- Health check failure (> 2 consecutive failures)
- API error rate > 5%
- Response time > 3 seconds
- Database connection failure
- SSL certificate expiry (< 30 days)

## Deployment Commands Reference

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Pre-deployment validation
./scripts/pre-deploy-checklist.sh

# Deploy to production (automated)
gh workflow run deploy-production.yml

# Deploy to production (manual)
./scripts/deploy-production.sh

# Post-deployment verification

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items ✅
- Infrastructure configuration
- Security hardening
- Database migrations
- Rollback procedures
- Monitoring setup

### Medium Risk Items ⚠️
- First production deployment (mitigated by staging validation)
- Performance under production load (mitigated by baselines)
- External service dependencies (mitigated by retries)

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Blue-green deployment** capability via Vercel
2. **Automatic rollback** on failure detection
3. **Comprehensive monitoring** with real-time alerts
4. **Load testing** validation in pre-deployment
5. **Database migration rollback** scripts available

## Evidence Commands

Execute these commands to verify security implementations:

```bash
# Run comprehensive legacy security tests
./scripts/test-api-endpoints.sh --focus legacy-security

# Validate security configuration
./scripts/validate-security-config.sh

# Check for remaining security issues
rg -n "extracted-from-token|Basic auth check|placeholder" api/ | wc -l
# Expected: 0

# Verify enhanced authentication usage
rg -n "requireAuthWithSecurity|authenticateRequestWithSecurity" api/ | wc -l
# Expected: 25+

# Run TypeScript regression test suite
npm test -- api/security/legacy-endpoint-regression-tests.ts

# Run dedicated legacy endpoint security tests
./scripts/test-legacy-endpoint-security.sh
```

## Recommendations for Continued Security

1. **Regular Security Testing**: Run the security regression tests as part of CI/CD pipeline
2. **Security Monitoring**: Monitor security event logs for unusual patterns
3. **Rate Limit Tuning**: Adjust rate limits based on production usage patterns
4. **Security Updates**: Keep security libraries and dependencies updated
5. **Penetration Testing**: Consider periodic third-party security audits

---

## Handoff to docs-writer

**Status**: READY FOR DOCUMENTATION
**Next Task**: Update security documentation with:
- Security architecture overview
- API endpoint security features
- Rate limiting configuration
- Security event monitoring setup
- Security testing procedures

All security regression testing is complete and all acceptance criteria have been met. The legacy endpoints are now properly secured and protected against common security vulnerabilities.

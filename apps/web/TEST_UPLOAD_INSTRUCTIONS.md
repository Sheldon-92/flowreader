# FlowReader Book Upload Testing Guide

## Overview
The book upload system has been fixed with the following improvements:

1. **API Endpoint Creation**: Created a local processing endpoint at `/api/upload/process`
2. **Error Handling**: Improved error display and user feedback
3. **Local Storage Fallback**: Books are saved to browser's local storage if database is unavailable
4. **Database Flexibility**: System works even without Supabase tables configured

## How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Make sure the development server is running:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Ensure you're logged in to the application

### Testing Steps

1. **Navigate to Library Page**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/library
   - You should see your library (empty if first time)

2. **Upload a Book**
   - Click the "Upload Book" button in the header
   - Select an EPUB file from your computer
   - Watch the progress indicator

3. **Expected Behavior**
   - Upload progress shows percentage
   - Success message appears when complete
   - Book appears in your library immediately
   - If database is not configured, book is saved locally

4. **Error Scenarios to Test**
   - Upload non-EPUB file (should show error)
   - Upload very large file (>50MB, should show size error)
   - Cancel upload mid-process
   - Try uploading same book twice

### Verifying Success

1. **Check Library Display**
   - Book should appear in the grid/list view
   - Title and author should be displayed
   - Book cover (if available) should show

2. **Check Browser Storage**
   - Open browser DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Application > Local Storage
   - Look for `flowreader_local_books` key
   - Should contain uploaded book data

3. **Check Console Logs**
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for upload status messages
   - Any warnings about database will show here

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Silent Upload Failures
- **Problem**: Upload failed without user feedback
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive error messages and status indicators

### 2. API Communication
- **Problem**: Client couldn't reach processing endpoint
- **Solution**: Created internal SvelteKit API route at `/api/upload/process`

### 3. Database Dependency
- **Problem**: System failed when Supabase tables weren't created
- **Solution**: Added local storage fallback with automatic detection

### 4. User Feedback
- **Problem**: No indication of upload progress or errors
- **Solution**: Added progress bar, success/error states, and retry options

## Modified Files

1. `/apps/web/src/routes/api/books/upload/+server.ts`
   - Fixed API endpoint URL
   - Added local storage support
   - Improved error handling

2. `/apps/web/src/routes/api/upload/process/+server.ts`
   - Created new processing endpoint
   - Mock EPUB processing for development

3. `/apps/web/src/lib/components/BookUpload.svelte`
   - Enhanced UI feedback
   - Added error display
   - Improved progress tracking

4. `/apps/web/src/routes/library/+page.svelte`
   - Added local storage fallback
   - Improved error states
   - Better loading indicators

5. `/apps/web/src/lib/stores/localBooks.ts`
   - Created local storage manager
   - Persistent book storage

## Troubleshooting

### Upload Fails Immediately
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're logged in
- Verify file is actually EPUB format

### Books Don't Appear in Library
- Refresh the page
- Check local storage in DevTools
- Look for console errors

### Database Connection Issues
- Books will be saved locally
- Check Supabase configuration
- Verify environment variables

## Next Steps for Production

1. **Set up Supabase Tables**:
   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE books (
     id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
     title TEXT NOT NULL,
     author TEXT,
     owner_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
     upload_date TIMESTAMP,
     -- other fields
   );
   ```

2. **Configure Storage**:
   - Set up Supabase Storage bucket for EPUB files
   - Configure proper permissions

3. **Deploy Processing Service**:
   - Deploy the API endpoints to production
   - Configure CORS and security headers

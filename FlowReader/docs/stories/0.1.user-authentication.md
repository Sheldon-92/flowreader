# Story 0.1: User Authentication & Account Management

## Status
âœ… **Approved** - Ready for Development

## Story

**As a** new or returning user,  
**I want** to securely create an account and log in to FlowReader,  
**so that** I can access my personal library, reading progress, and AI conversations across all my devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Account Registration**
   - User can create a new account using email and password
   - Password requirements: minimum 8 characters, complexity validation
   - Email verification required before account activation
   - Clear error messages for validation failures (weak password, existing email, etc.)
   - UI provides progress feedback and retry options for email delivery (no SLA commitment for external email service)

2. **User Login & Session Management**
   - User can log in with email and password credentials
   - Failed login attempts are limited (5 attempts before temporary lockout)
   - Successful login redirects to user's personal library
   - Session remains active for 30 days with automatic token refresh (sliding expiration)
   - Automatic logout after 7 days of complete inactivity (hard expiration overrides refresh)
   - "Remember me" option for convenient future access

3. **Account Security**
   - Password reset functionality via email verification
   - Secure session management with httpOnly cookies
   - Automatic logout after extended inactivity (7 days)
   - Account lockout protection against brute force attacks
   - All authentication data encrypted and securely stored

4. **Cross-Device Authentication**
   - Login state synchronizes across multiple devices immediately
   - User can log out from all devices remotely (via Supabase session revocation)
   - Device-specific session management and security
   - Reading progress and data sync after authentication

5. **User Profile Management**
   - User can view and edit basic profile information (email, display name)
   - Subscription tier and usage quotas displayed clearly
   - Account deletion functionality with data export option
   - Privacy settings and data management controls

6. **Integration with Core Features**
   - All protected routes require valid authentication
   - User context properly passed to all FlowReader features
   - Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce data isolation
   - Seamless integration with book library, notes, and AI conversations

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context
- Authentication leverages Supabase Auth for security and compliance
- Frontend uses Supabase Auth helpers for SvelteKit integration
- All user data protected by Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Session management follows security best practices with httpOnly cookies

### Key Technical Specifications
- **Provider**: Supabase Auth with email/password authentication
- **Session Duration**: 30 days with automatic refresh
- **Security**: Password complexity, rate limiting, account lockout
- **Integration**: Direct integration with all user-specific features

### Integration Points
- Required for all other user stories (Story 1.1+)
- User context flows to library, reading, AI, and notes features
- Database RLS policies depend on authenticated user context
- Cross-device sync requires user authentication state

### Security Implementation
- **Password Policy**: 8+ characters, mix of letters/numbers/symbols
- **Session Security**: httpOnly cookies, secure transmission, automatic refresh with 7-day hard expiry
- **Rate Limiting**: 5 login attempts per 15 minutes per IP (implemented in Edge Functions)
- **Data Protection**: All user data isolated by RLS policies
- **Audit Events**: Login failures, account lockouts, password resets, remote logouts
- **Session Strategy**: Supabase Auth with refresh token revocation for remote logout

### Testing

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- Unit tests for authentication logic and validation
- Integration tests for Supabase Auth flows
- E2E tests for complete registration and login workflows
- Security tests for rate limiting and session management

**Testing Standards**:
- Authentication flow testing with valid and invalid credentials
- Session persistence testing across browser restarts
- Cross-device login synchronization testing
- Security testing for brute force and session hijacking protection

**Specific Test Cases**:
- User registration with email verification
- Login with valid and invalid credentials
- Password reset flow with email verification
- Session timeout and automatic logout
- Cross-device login state synchronization
- Rate limiting on failed login attempts
- Account deletion with data cleanup verification
